### Use of external information

You are generally allowed to use external information while developing your runs.
When you submit your runs, please fill in a form listing what resources you used.
This could include an external corpus such as Wikipedia or a pretrained model (e.g. word embeddings, BERT).
This could also include the provided set of document ranking training data, but also optionally other data such as the passage ranking task labels or external labels or pretrained models.
This will allow us to analyze the runs and break they down into types.
